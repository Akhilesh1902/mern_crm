Final Project | CRM @[ArkX](https://www.arkx.group/)

## Introduction: What is a CRM?
[**Customer relationship management (CRM)**](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/what-is-crm/) is a technology for managing all your company’s relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers. The goal is simple: Improve business relationships to grow your business. A CRM system helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.

a **CRM system**, on the other hand is a tool that helps with contact management, sales management, agent productivity, and more. CRM tools can now be used to manage customer relationships across the entire customer lifecycle, spanning marketing, sales, digital commerce, and customer service interactions.

## Description
Given the critical importance of such tool in modern business operations, this project builds a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The CRM aims to improve customer interaction management and sales efficiency for businesses, particularly focusing on **general business needs**. However, the core functionalities can be easily adapted to various industries.
